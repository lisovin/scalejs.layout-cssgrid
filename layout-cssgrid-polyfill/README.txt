This is a "hello world" application - when run it will show "Hello World" in the browser.

Prerequisites:
1. PowerShell 3.0 or later
2. IIS Express (installed via Web Platform Installer)
3. node.js (http://nodejs.org/) needed to build the application
4. requirejs optimizer (once node.js is installed run: npm install -g requirejs)

Assuming all prerequisites run the app using normal CTRL + F5. 
This will run IIS Express site at http://localhost:8888

To open debug version of the app go to http://localhost:8888
To open release version go to http://localhost:8888/index.release.html
To open debug version go to http://localhost:8888/index.debug.html
To open tests go to http://localhost:8888/index.test.html

If you see "Hello World!" on the page everything worked as expected.
